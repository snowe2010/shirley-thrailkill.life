Shirley Ann Thrailkill

May 21, 1956 - June 28, 2020 

Shirley Ann Thrailkill (nee Wertke)

Shirley was born on May 21, 1956 at McHenry Hospital in Woodstock, Illinois. She was the middle child of Russell and Betty Wertke. Shirley was raised in Volo, Illinois with her older sister, Barbara, and younger brother, Ed. She attended grade school in McHenry, Illinois and graduated in 1974 from Grant High School in Fox Lake. In school she learned to play the French Horn and developed a love of music. At the age of 15 she was chosen to go to Europe with the United States Collegiate Wind Band to play in the capitals of five countries. This trip was the beginning of her love of travel and learning about other countries.

In high school, Shirley was chosen as an exchange student to go to Japan. She loved the country, and especially connected with the people’s love of music. Her desire was to move to Japan to teach music. She continued studying Japan while pursuing her music degree from the University of Illinois. Her wish was to teach music in Japan, but she found that there were requirements that she did not have the money to pursue. On her own she made contact with an English school in Japan, and lived in Japan for seven years teaching English to adults. During that time she learned to speak and write perfect Japanese. She learned the customs and traditions, and how to cook Japanese food. As her mother says, “when she returned home after seven years she was like a Japanese woman.”

After arriving home, she got a job as an international liaison with a firm in Schaumburg. While setting up for a convention at McCormick Place, she met Clifton Thrailkill. They immediately fell in love and she soon moved to Duncanville, Texas. They dated for two years, and were married on May 19, 1990 at the home of Clifton’s sister.

Together Shirley and Clifton had two sons, Tyler and Russell, who were the loves of Shirley’s life. Clifton’s daughters, Aimee and Stephanie, were also loved unconditionally by Shirley. The family moved to Waco in 1993.

Life was not perfect, but together they overcame many obstacles. Shirley studied to get her teaching certificate and began to teach second grade at Cedar Ridge Elementary School. She loved teaching but eventually began to have some issues with the demands of the job. Her doctor thought she had anxiety from stress at school, but it soon became apparent that something more serious was going on. She was diagnosed with Dementia in 2012. Her family was heartbroken by how upset she was when she could no longer write her name. Dementia is a slow death, and was a devastating process for the family as well as Shirley.

Shirley was blessed to be able to go to Colorado for her son Tyler’s wedding in September of 2018. Her caregivers made all the difference in her last few months. Her family is grateful for the support of Kim, Sharon, Christy, Melody, Jenny, Chelle, and all the amazing caretakers at Providence Hospice in Waco.

Shirley was preceded in death by her father, Russell Wertke. She is survived by her loving husband Clifton Thrailkill, son Tyler Thrailkill and wife Sabrina, son Russell Thrailkill, mother Betty Wertke, sister Barbara Johnson and husband Richard, brother Ed Wertke and wife Katherine. Other family members include Aimee Dyson and husband Rob, their children Riley, Brannon, and Aleice; Stephanie Ridder and husband Ryan, and their children Reese, Cody, and Gavin.

Shirley had one true lifelong best friend, Yvonne Maassel Crow. They grew up together from a young age, and kept in close contact and remained the best of friends despite the distance between them.

Shirley had a loving faith in the goodness of others. She was helpful and always shared her talent with others. The world has lost a very special person, wife, mother, and daughter. She will be missed by her family and friends. Shirley’s body was be donated to science in order to advance dementia research as her final act of selflessness and generosity.
